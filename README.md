# foward_backward_sweep
This is a very simple implementation of the Forward-Backward sweep method to solve a power flow in radial distribution systems

There are four basic implementations depending if you want to use ZIP or just P models in your circuit. Secondly there is a version for the balanced single phase equivalent and the four wire case, where you use the neutral conductor of the cable in order to calculate the power flow.

ToDo: Upload example usages!
